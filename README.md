# Conway's Game of Life
The game of life written exclusively in OCaml
(but not in functional style), based on Module Graphics.
Supports pausing, inserting new cells using mouse, 
changing speed and cells color averaging. 
There are no dependencies, its compiled with one-line command using 
ocamlc. (If OCaml is installed, 'make' command should just work).
